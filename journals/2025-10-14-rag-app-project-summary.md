## 🤖 Example Ollama RAG Outputs

### Example 1: Business Use Cases Question
**Question:** "What are the business use cases people have built for their business use cases?"

**System Response:**
```
🤖 Answer:
----------------------------------------
Based on the provided engineering blogs, we can identify several key takeaways regarding business use cases and their development.

Firstly, there are various business use cases that have been built for different industries and purposes. For instance, customers ordering (cart building, post check-out, etc.) and shoppers picking up in stores are two major use cases. However, with the pandemic, there have been more diverse use case scenarios raising new challenges (Source 1). Therefore, it is essential to review and comply with privacy and cyber security standards before deploying any use case in production (Source 4).

Secondly, integrating multiple use cases into a single model can lead to a flexible design that accommodates future-proofing (Source 7). This approach allows for the onboarding of new use-cases using the same infrastructure, simplifying the process and reducing the need for extensive re-engineering.

Thirdly, there are different budget targets for model inferencing costs and pre- and post-processing logic for different business use cases (Source 5). Therefore, it is important to consider these factors when developing a system to ensure that it can handle various use cases without compromising performance.

In terms of practical insights, it is essential to have a thorough review process to ensure that use cases comply with privacy and cyber security standards before deployment (Source 4). Additionally, consolidating multiple use cases into a single model can simplify the onboarding process for new use-cases (Source 7).

In terms of system design principles, it is important to consider flexibility and extensibility when developing a system to accommodate various business use cases. This can be achieved by using variable request context schemas and incorporating pre- and post-processing logic specific to each use case (Sources 5 & 7).

In conclusion, business use cases are critical in different industries, and their development requires careful consideration of privacy, cyber security, budget, and flexibility. By synthesizing the information from the provided engineering blogs, we can identify key takeaways regarding the development of business use cases and provide practical insights and system design principles for their successful implementation.

### Example 2: System Design Architecture Question
**Question:** "How do companies design scalable systems for multiple business use cases?"

**System Response:**
```
🤖 Answer:
----------------------------------------
Based on the provided engineering blogs, we can identify several key architectural patterns and design principles for building scalable systems that support multiple business use cases.

4. Central setup: This involves establishing a centralized infrastructure for managing use cases, ensuring that they undergo a thorough review process to comply with privacy and cyber security standards before being deployed in production.

5. Platformisation benefits: This refers to the potential advantages of using a platform-based approach to managing use cases, such as the ability to scale and adapt quickly in response to changing business needs.

6. Business Logic: This involves designing models that are flexible enough to accommodate multiple types of items (e.g., videos, games, people, etc.) and budget targets for model inferencing costs.

7. Consolidating multiple use cases into a single model: This approach allows for more efficient use of resources and simplifies the process of onboarding new use-cases on the same infrastructure.

8. Second use case — Documentation Generation: This involves generating documentation automatically, freeing up resources that can be used to support other business needs.

In terms of practical insights and real-world applications, it is important to recognize that business use cases are not a one-time event, but rather an ongoing process. As business needs evolve, so too must the systems and processes in place to support them. By continuously evaluating and refining their use cases, organizations can ensure that their systems are aligned with changing business requirements, leading to improved efficiency and competitiveness.

In terms of actionable advice and system design principles, it is essential to prioritize flexibility and scalability when designing for multiple use cases. This involves using modular, extensible architectures that can adapt quickly to changing requirements without sacrificing performance or functionality. Additionally, establishing a centralized infrastructure for managing use cases can help ensure consistency and compliance across different business units and applications.

Finally, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the information provided in the context. For example, there may be additional factors or considerations that are not explicitly mentioned, such as regulatory requirements or user experience concerns. By carefully evaluating these factors and incorporating them into system design decisions, organizations can create more effective and efficient systems that meet the needs of their users and support business success.
