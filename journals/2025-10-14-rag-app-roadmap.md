# RAG App Roadmap for System Design Interview Prep

**Date**: January 15, 2025  
**Project**: System Design Interview RAG Application  
**Data Source**: Tech Blog Content from Major Companies  

## üéØ **Project Overview**

Building a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application specifically designed for system design interview preparation using extracted tech blog content from major companies. The dataset contains rich technical content including text, images, and metadata that will serve as an excellent knowledge base for interview preparation.

## üìä **Current Data Assets**

- **Text Content**: Rich technical blog posts from major tech companies
- **Images**: Architecture diagrams, code snippets, system designs
- **Metadata**: Company information, tags, extraction quality, timestamps
- **Structure**: Organized by blog directories with individual content files
- **Quality**: High-quality content from companies like Uber, Netflix, LinkedIn, etc.

## üó∫Ô∏è **Development Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Data Preparation & Preprocessing** üìä

#### **1.1 Data Cleaning & Standardization**
```python
# Data pipeline tasks:
- Clean and normalize blog content
- Extract structured metadata (company, tech stack, architecture patterns)
- Remove duplicates and low-quality content
- Standardize formatting and encoding
- Handle multi-language content
- Extract code snippets and technical terms
```

#### **1.2 Content Categorization**
```python
# Categorize by system design topics:
categories = {
    "distributed_systems": ["microservices", "load_balancing", "consistency", "CAP_theorem"],
    "databases": ["SQL", "NoSQL", "sharding", "replication", "ACID", "BASE"],
    "caching": ["Redis", "CDN", "memcached", "cache_strategies", "cache_invalidation"],
    "messaging": ["Kafka", "RabbitMQ", "event_streaming", "pub_sub", "message_queues"],
    "scalability": ["horizontal_scaling", "vertical_scaling", "auto_scaling", "load_balancing"],
    "reliability": ["fault_tolerance", "circuit_breakers", "monitoring", "alerting", "SLA"],
    "security": ["authentication", "authorization", "encryption", "OAuth", "JWT"],
    "monitoring": ["logging", "metrics", "tracing", "observability", "APM"],
    "deployment": ["CI/CD", "containerization", "orchestration", "infrastructure_as_code"]
}
```

#### **1.3 Text Chunking Strategy**
```python
# Chunking approaches:
- Semantic chunking (by topics/sections)
- Fixed-size chunks with overlap (512-1024 tokens)
- Hierarchical chunking (blog ‚Üí sections ‚Üí paragraphs)
- Metadata-aware chunking (preserve context)
- Code-aware chunking (preserve code blocks)
- Image-text pairing (associate images with relevant text)
```

### **Phase 2: Vector Database & Embeddings** üß†

#### **2.1 Embedding Model Selection**
```python
# Recommended models for technical content:
- text-embedding-ada-002 (OpenAI) - Good for general tech content
- sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 - Fast and efficient
- sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2 - Better quality
- sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2 - Best for technical content
- Custom fine-tuned model on your tech blog data
- Multi-modal embeddings for text + images
```

#### **2.2 Vector Database Setup**
```python
# Options comparison:
- Pinecone (managed, easy to use, good for production)
